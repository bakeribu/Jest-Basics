Chapter 1:(Basics of Jest and Unit Testing)
1. Jest is a unit-testing Java-script framework used for unit testing before deploying a program.
2. Unit-testing are short programs that test whether a function works correctly in isolation from other parts of your application.
3. There are basic four steps that need to be applied for the unit-testing.
4. There are three things that need to be focused on while performing a unit-testing i.e input-function,output and expected result.

The basic four steps to follow while unit testing:
1. import the function to test.
2. give an input to the function.
3. define what to expect as the output.
4. check if the function produces the expected output.

There will be always two categories:
1. One file where the input/logic/algorithm is written.
2. Second file where the logic is checked by creating test-cases by taking the input function/file where the algorithm is written.

keywords used in the test functions:
1. test
2. expect
3. matcher(toBe,toEqual)

Basic Syntax for the test function:
test("", () => {})
1. It has two parameters:
-> string: which tells what the function is going to do.
-> function: which have the expected result for the input function.(Using expect and matchers).


Chapter 2:(Matchers)
1. There are various matchers used while forming a test case.
2. The various matchers can be toBeNULL,toBeUndefined,toBeDefined etc.
3. Each matcher has it's own use and function.

Various Types of Matchers:
1. toEqual: is used when the input array/object is compared with the expected result.
2. toBeLessThan: is used compare the input with value which is less than or equal to a given value in the test function
3. toMatch: is used to check whether the character is in the expected string or not.
4. toContain: is used to check whether the input element is contained in the Array or not.

Chapter 3:(Asynchronous Code)
1. In java-script it is common to run asynchronous code so to create or handle such data various methods are used.
2. Asynchronous data executes the operations in parallel.
